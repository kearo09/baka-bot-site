    <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 2025</p>

    <p>
        The Baka Bot provides digital services, premium memberships, and in-bot features.
        Since everything is delivered instantly online, we follow a fair and transparent policy
        for cancellations and refunds.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Digital Product Nature</h2>
    <p>
        All items and memberships provided by Baka Bot are digital.  
        Once a feature is delivered or activated inside the bot, it is considered **used**.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
        Refunds will only be provided under the following conditions:
    </p>

    <p>
        • Payment was made, but premium features were **not activated** due to technical issues.<br>
        • Duplicate payments for the same feature.<br>
        • Wrong amount charged due to a system error.
    </p>

    <p>
        Refunds will <strong>not</strong> be provided if:
    </p>

    <p>
        • The user has already used or accessed the premium features.<br>
        • The purchase was made by mistake but features were delivered.<br>
        • User expected a different type of feature or result after using the bot.<br>
        • User violated the bot rules and premium was disabled due to abuse.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>
        Since Baka Bot delivers all digital features instantly, cancellations are only possible
        **before the feature is activated**.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Processing Time</h2>
    <p>
        Approved refunds will be credited back within **5–10 business days** depending on the
        user’s bank/payment gateway.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Extensions or Access Issues</h2>
    <p>
        If your premium service expires early or activation fails, contact support and
        we will restore or extend your access free of cost.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Non-Refundable Cases</h2>
    <p>
        • Refunds will not be issued for non-usage of service after activation.<br>
        • No refunds if the user is banned for breaking Telegram or bot rules.<br>
        • No refunds for "change of mind" after feature delivery.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Contact for Refunds</h2>
    <p>
        For refund requests, email us at:<br>
        <strong>support@baka-bot.com</strong>  
        (You can change this email later.)
